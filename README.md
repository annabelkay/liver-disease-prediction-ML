# Liver Disease Prediction - Machine Learning (MATLAB)

## Description üñãÔ∏è

This repository demonstrates the usage of a Random Forest Model to predict patients with liver disease.

### Original Dataset:

You can find the original dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/indian-liver-patient-records).

### Implementation Details:

Here are the relevant implementation details including instructions on how to train and run the models to reproduce the optimised results.

To test the model, please run the following MATLAB files:

- `Random_Forests_Model.md` for the Random Forest model. This includes the optimisation methods.

#### Clean Dataset:

- `liver_disease_clean_data.csv` contains the clean data outputted by pre-processing.
